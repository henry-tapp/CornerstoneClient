# Pages

My plan is that each entry point (in our high level LoQueue terms a Web Component) is a single folder within this `pages` folder (at-least for now).

This keeps the entry point and all code specific to that component contained (where it can't be refactored into a more re-usable component and stored in the `components` parent folder).

This may not be the nicest way to handle this for now so I'll rethink it as we go along.
