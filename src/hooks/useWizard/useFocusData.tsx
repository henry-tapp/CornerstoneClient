For example, a climber that has a max hang of 92kg (70kg bodyweight + 22kg extra load), 60% would be 92 * 0.6 = 55kg.

You will need a hangboard with a pulley system. Attach the 60% measurement above, this would be 55kg in the example.

Then using the 7/3 hangboard repeater protocol, hang for 7 seconds then rest for 3 seconds. 

Repeat until failure. 

Measure the total number of repeats. Multiplied by 10 is the total number of seconds. Record this as the measurement.

Start by hanging on a 20mm edge with your feet taking most of the weight, for 10 seconds. 

After 3 minutes of rest hang from 20mm for 10 seconds.

After 3 minutes of rest between each set, increase attached weight by 2-5kg until a max hang score is achieved. 

Stop immediately if you experience any discomfort.

Your score is the total weight + bodyweight. E.g. a climber who weighs 70kg and can hang with an added 22kg scores 92kg.
